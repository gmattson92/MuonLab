in order to compile and run the DAQ software, you must have the correct versions of gcc and root loaded:

$ module load root/6.02.08
$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/home/masonrh2/soft/cheat_libs
$ module swap gcc openmpi/4.0.1-gcc4.8.5

I have these commands in my .bashrc, but hopefully one day we will have a students account
if that day comes, and if we are still using this outdated software, we should put these commands
in that account's .bashrc

if the computer are restarted, you will probably also need fix the usb
in that case, do
$ source /home/masonrh2/Desktop/fix_ubs.sh
NOTE THIS REQUIRES SUDO ACCESS

troubleshooting:
check the versions of gcc and root
$ which root
should give version 6.02.08
$ gcc -v
should give version 4.8.5
if they are the wrong version and you already tried "module load ...", you can try:
$ module swap root root/6.02.08
or 
$ module swap gcc openmpi/4.0.1-gcc4.8.5
for some reason the module may clear itself or revert to another version and I'm not sure why
if you can't get the versions right, try loading them in a different order

note that the file in /home/masonrh2/soft/cheat_libs is simply a soft link to /usr/lib64/libpcre.so
you can make such links with:
$ sudo ln -s /path/to/file /path/to/new/link/to/that/file
a link is like a shortcut and tricks the compiler into thinking we actually have libpcre.so.0

STARTING HV:
1) turn on hv crate
2) double click labview shortcut on desktop of leftmost computer
3) change IP adress to the correct one (see sticky note on computer second from the left)
4) click "enter text" at the top left (hitting enter key after typing IP does NOT work)
5) click run at the top left
6) click main power button

USEFUL COMMANDS:

$ ldconfig -p | grep mylibrary
finds where mylibrary is hiding
